        <p>Hello, my name is Nathan Cashman and I’m a software developer transitioning into the field 
          from a career as music educator. I graduated from Drake University with a degree in music 
          education and spent some time working in the field before realizing education wasn’t my 
          passion. I am passionate about learning concepts and practices integral to creating helpful 
          and innovative software. My most recent successes have been through the DeltaV Code School 
          in Cedar Rapids, where I worked with others to create interactive websites. In the groups 
          I’ve been a part of, I contributed to the success of each project by identifying project 
          requirements and risks, delegating responsibilities, debugging complex code, and overall 
          keeping communication strong and effective within the group. </p>
